## Maze Game 🧩🏃‍♂️
This is a simple maze game developed as part of a university exercise to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using Phaser. In the game, you control a character who must collect keys and avoid enemies to open doors and advance to the next level.

### Level 1
The first level was created by the professor and involves collecting a key to open the door and advance to the next level.

### Level 2
Our objective was to create the second level of the game. In this level, the player must collect two keys while avoiding faster enemies to open the door and win the game.

Feel free to check out the code and suggest improvements! 🏃‍♂️🔑🚪
